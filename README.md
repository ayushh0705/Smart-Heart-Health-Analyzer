# Heart Disease Prediction and Diagnostic Tool
Overview
The Heart Disease Prediction and Diagnostic Tool is a machine learning-based project designed to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on their health data. The model uses a Logistic Regression algorithm and is deployed as a user-friendly web application built with Streamlit. This tool enables users to input key health metrics and receive a prediction in real-time, aiding in early detection and decision-making.

# Features
Predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on 13 health-related parameters.
Utilizes a Logistic Regression model trained on a heart disease dataset for accurate predictions.
Provides an intuitive web interface with interactive input fields for seamless user experience.
Delivers predictions instantly, improving accessibility for non-technical users.
